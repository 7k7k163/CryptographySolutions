# CryptographySolutions
Exercise Solutions of Introduction to Modern Cryptography (2nd edition) written by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell 

## Motivation 
I searched all the web but cannot find a solution manual for _**Introduction to Modern Cryptography**_ \(2nd edition\) written by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell. 
I searched Github then I found two students that solved the Exercises voluntary, [@LuminousXLB](https://github.com/LuminousXLB) & [@contivero](https://github.com/contivero) I really thank you both for what have you done.
So I decided to combine all solutions in one place, one folder, so would be easy accessible for students.

## Request
If there's anything wrong or missing, please open an issue or open a pull request. 
If you want a solution for a problem that hasn't been listed here, please open an issue and we may discucss together.
Feel free to fork or open issues, there are many Exercises left without answers.
